**Disclaimer:** This project is currently in early development ðŸš§

## Introducion

Telescope is a next generation planning tool focused on productivity and usability for your team.

At its core, Telescope offers an efficient way of creating, listing, and viewing your projects tasks. Inspired by other great planning tools, telescope provides you with plenty of customization and extensibility, allowing it to fit your specific needs.

## Features
- Implements an easy to use task hierarchy (Boards > Lists > Tasks)
- Instant live syncing across multiple browsers
- User and account management on a per-board basis
- Self hosted for full control over your data and setup
- Support for theming and customized themes
- Extensible with plugins and an easy to use API
- Fully open source and licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Telescope is built using [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) which means you will need to install NodeJS version 9 or higher. Make sure you also install npm, the package manager for node (it usually comes bundled with node).

### Setup
First, obtain a copy of Telescope by cloning it from this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:ExodiusStudios/telescope.git
```

Once you have obtained a local copy from github, run the following commands to prepare your instance of Telescope.
```
npm install -g yarn    # Install the yarn package manager
yarn install           # Install required dependencies
chmod +x ./telescope   # Grant execute permission to the CLI
```

*Notice: If you decide to help contribute to Telescope, this setup will get you development ready as well ;)*

### Using the CLI (Command Line Interface)

The CLI provides a useful array of commands allowing you to manage your Telescope setup. In order to launch Telescope, run the following command:

```
./telescope start
```

Telescope will be started in the background and can now be accessed on `http://localhost:8045`.


The CLI provides many more commands used to manage your Telescope setup. The following snippet is directly generated from `./telescope help`.

```
./telescope <cmd> [options]

Commands:
  telescope start    Launch the Telescope server
  telescope stop     Terminate the Telescope server
  telescope status   Show the current daemon status
  telescope run      Start the Telescope server in the foreground
  telescope config   Display the Telescope config
  telescope compile  Build the telescope client and server

Options:
  --version  Show version number
  --json     Print out all messages in JSON form
  --help     Show help
```

## Development setup
Before you can start contributing to Telescope, make sure to follow the installation tutorial. 

### Run development setup
A development setup with hot reloading can be started with the following two commands (You may have to run them in separate terminals).

```
yarn dev:client
yarn dev:server
```

When working on the source code, the frontend and backend will automatically be reloaded as you save files.

### Building distribution files
Distributes files are built separately for the client and server

```
yarn build:client
yarn build:server

# Shortcut to run both commands at once
./telescope compile
```
